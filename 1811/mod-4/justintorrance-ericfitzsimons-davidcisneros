 # Code Quality

 #### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub (from either repository) that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/DevelopingDavid/palette-picker-ui/blob/master/src/Components/CardContainer/CardContainer.js)
lines 148 - 180

 * Why were you proud of this piece of code?  
- Lines 30-47: generateRandomColors function. We completely refactored this function, scaled it down, and made it more efficient. We originally generated 5 random colors; however, we didn't account for locking the colors and then being able to generate additional colors to push into that array. We also had to completely restructure our data, and add a isLocked (value = bool) property.

 #### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/DevelopingDavid/palette-picker-ui/blob/master/src/HeaderBar/HeaderBar.js)

 * Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
- This is mostly a design issue. We feel there is a lot happening in the sidebar but not enough happening in the center piece.
Working with Material UI took some valuable time to learn.

 #### Link to Design Inspiration

 * Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it  
[design inspiration](https://coolors.co/ed254e-f9dc5c-f4fffd-011936-465362)    
- We stole the design of the palette display but turned them into card instead of columns. 
- We used lock icons and displayed the hex codes similarly.

 #### Reflection on New Concepts

 * Describe your thoughts on server-side testing  
- It is quite straight-forward, and we found it simpler than front-end testing.
* Describe your thoughts on TravisCI  
- Black magic. It does streamline some processes, though it is a pain to set up.
* Describe your thoughts in creating a single project whose codebase was distributed across multiple repositories
- It makes a lot of sense to us to have the backend separate from the frontend, but connected using fetch calls.
